Evil Tree (Full Set)

One of my first "complete" 3d environment sets, the package includes all of the objects you see in the preview and wireframe renders; tree, rocks, gravestones01,02, and a skull model.  The objects together contain 47,832 polygons; 47,850 vertices (99.6% quad polygons, 0.3% triangles, 0 ngons).  All models have been carefully UV unwrapped, with minimal texture distortion.  There are 18 high resolution maps included in this set (4096 x 4096 px); each object containing it's own color, specular, and normal maps.  It is highly recommended to use the normal maps with your own custom materials for optimum render detail.

*The Daz files have been scaled to import perfectly in Daz|Studio 4.x., and should also import in an approximate location and size in Poser.  See the import instructions below for detailed information on how to import the models in this set to the DAZ Studio software.

The Blender folder contains all the OBJ files, scaled specifically for import in Blender.  Also included is a bonus .blend file, with very basic Cycles materials already applied, and simple environment lighting.

All example renders were done with the Iray render engine, in Daz Studio, after importing the models with the recommended settings.

You are free to use or modify this model as you see fit, for your own rendering projects or scenes. As with all my freebies, the object can be used for both commercial and non-commercial renders. You may NOT, however, resell or redistribute the model or textures, or any derivative of them; individually, or as part of a package/set.


*** OBJ IMPORT INSTRUCTIONS: There are 3 different OBJ file folders associated with this model set, and one MAPS folder, which holds all the essential HD maps.  You will notice that each folder is labeled for use with a particular software, except the Default folder, which contains OBJ files for use in most other software applications, like Modo or Maya.  For best results, it's highly recommended that you import the correct file to the corresponding software application.

DAZ STUDIO / POSER USERS:  The OBJ files included in the DAZ_OBJ folder were exported with a scale conversion that will allow the object to load each object with appropriate scaling into Daz Studio 4.x and above, with Poser import preset settings, or Poser 9 and above. To import this file into Daz Studio 4.x; first, select File > Import, and navigate to the Daz_OBJ folder.  Choose a file.  In the OBJImportOptions dialogue box, be sure to select the Poser (1 Unit = 8 Ft) Preset option in the "From:" dropdown menu.  Scale should be set to 24384% automatically.  If not, then please enter that value into the Scale field.  Keep the Axis Conversion X=X, Y=Y, and Z=Z, with NO checkboxes in the Invert Direction options.  Be sure Read Groups, UV Coordinates, Surfaces, and Material Library (.mtl) are all checked.  The objects are designed to import in place on a default empty scene environment.  Some, but not all, of the included maps may load with each object, but you will be required to customize your materials for each object, and adjust each map manually, for best results.  I recommend rendering with the new Iray render engine.

Please let me know if you have any questions, or issues with this product.  I stand behind all of my models, even the free ones, with full tech support.  Thanks!

Thanks,
John
